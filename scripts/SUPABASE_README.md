# Supabase Connection Setup

This guide provides instructions for setting up the Supabase connection and creating the necessary table structure.

## Connection Status

The connection to your Supabase project at `https://yyfypeedlmgqqhukjhbe.supabase.co` was **successful**. 

The script successfully authenticated with your provided credentials, but attempts to access or create the `text_entries` table failed because the table doesn't exist yet.

## Creating the Required Table

To create the necessary table in your Supabase database, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard at [https://app.supabase.com/](https://app.supabase.com/)
2. Select your project (`yyfypeedlmgqqhukjhbe`)
3. Navigate to the SQL Editor (in the left sidebar)
4. Create a new query
5. Copy and paste the contents of the `create_supabase_table.sql` file provided in this directory
6. Run the query to create the table and set up the appropriate permissions

The SQL script will:
- Create a `text_entries` table with UUID primary keys, content text field, and automatic timestamps
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
- Set up appropriate policies to allow reading, inserting, and updating entries

## Running the Test Script

Once you've created the table, you can run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Navigate to your Web directory
cd /Users/rocordov/Web

# Activate the virtual environment
source scripts/supabase_env/bin/activate

# Run the script
python scripts/supabaseconnect.py
```

If successful, you should see:
1. A successful connection message
2. A confirmation that a test entry was created
3. A list of any existing entries in the table

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Authentication errors**: Verify your Supabase URL and anonymous key are correct
2. **Table not found errors**: Ensure you've created the `text_entries` table using the provided SQL script
3. **Permission errors**: Check that the RLS policies have been properly set up

## Next Steps

Once you've confirmed the connection works, you can:

1. Integrate this functionality into your web application
2. Extend the script to add more features (like deletion, filtering, etc.)
3. Implement user authentication for more secure access control
